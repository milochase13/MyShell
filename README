A homemade shell with many functionalities including directory changing, listing. Also included is batch command capabilities. Given a file of commands, this shell is capable of executing all of them in order. MyShell also supports redirection of outputs to an external file and advanced redirection of outputs to a file which already contains output values, inserting new values at the top of the file.
