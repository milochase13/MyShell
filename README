A homemade shell with many functionalities including directory changing, listing, and other standard features. 

Additional Features: 
* Batch command capabilities. Given a file of commands, this shell is capable of executing all of them in order. 
* Redirection of outputs to an external file 
* Advanced redirection of outputs to a file which already contains data, inserting new values at the top of the file. 
* Multiple commands can be executed on one line by dividing them with a semi-colon. 

Whitespaces are ignored. Developed by me in CS154 @ UChicago
