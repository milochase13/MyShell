A homemade shell with many functionalities including directory changing, listing. Also included is batch command capabilities. Given a file of commands, this shell is capable of executing all of them in order. MyShell also supports redirection of outputs to an external file and advanced redirection of outputs to a file which already contains data, inserting new values at the top of the file. In addition, multiple commands can be executed on one line by dividing them with a semi-colon. Whitespaces are ignored. Developed my me in CS154 @ UChicago
